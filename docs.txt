My current interest for roles within this group is to 
either work on the front end or docmentaiton of development.
I have little experience working of working with backend since
I have barely touched anything about data bases. I often found
myself working on documenting and working on the interface of
various projects more than back end. Im accustomed to presenting
condense information to peers and instructors in simpler terms.
