I bring a full-stack skill set to my group, with experience in both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js, and NextJS to build responsive sites. On the backend, I have experience with Firebase, Python, SQL, Pandas, Streamlit, and PyTorch, allowing me to handle databases, data pipelines, and machine learning integrations. I also have GitHub experience for collaboration and version control, and familiarity with DevOps tools such as Vercel and Netlify for deployment and hosting. My role will be focused on bridging frontend and backend tasks while ensuring smooth deployment.
